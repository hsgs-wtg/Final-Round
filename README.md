# Final-Round

## For task A

Checkout master. We have two algos. Run src/main.py and src/main_delta.py to reproduce.

## For task B

Checkout tag v1.0.0. This code contains a few bugs that are fixed later, but still produces correct results.

## Checker code

Guaranteed to work on Windows only. May or may not work on Linux (probably won't work). Don't know how, or why. Raise an Issue if you found out.

## Notes

Quick and dirty repo was created by 4 students in 3 days, so don't look inside or you'll cringe all over. If you really need to, raise an Issue and we may or may not give clarifications (because no single person in our team knows every part of the code).
